# Festival Sales Data Analysis & Marketing Strategy By Python

This repository contains the code and insights derived from analyzing sales data from the previous year's Diwali festival. The analysis identified key customer demographics, buying behaviors, and geographic hotspots, which form the basis for a focused marketing strategy to boost sales by 20-30% in the upcoming festival season.

## üéØ **Key Insights**

1. **Demographics**: Over 70% of the purchasers were female, primarily in the 18-35 age group.
2. **Marital Status**: A majority of these buyers were unmarried.
3. **Top States**: The highest sales were recorded in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, and Madhya Pradesh.
4. **Occupation**: A significant number of customers were corporate professionals.

  - Spotlight products tailored for females aged 18-35, focusing on personal and professional needs.
  - Launch exclusive collections such as self-care, fashion, and career-related products.

### 2. Special Offers for Unmarried Customers
  - Design exclusive offers for unmarried female buyers, who made up a large portion of the market.
  - Introduce similar offers for unmarried males to broaden the customer base.

### 3. EMI Options for Corporate Buyers
